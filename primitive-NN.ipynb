    "## Primitive Neural Network\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to create a **functional neural network from scratch** without relying on libraries like TensorFlow or Keras.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What will we use?\n",
    "Instead of pre-built frameworks, we will focus on:\n",
    "- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.\n",
    "- **Linear Algebra**: To perform operations like matrix multiplication and vector transformations.\n",
    "- **Mathematical Equations**: To implement neural network operations such as activation functions, weight updates, and backpropagation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why build a neural network from scratch?\n",
    "Creating a neural network manually helps us:\n",
    "- **Understand the inner workings** of neural networks.\n",
    "- Gain insight into how concepts like **weights, biases, forward propagation, and backpropagation** come together.\n",
    "- Build a strong foundation for designing and debugging more complex machine learning models in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we'll use the **MNIST dataset** to train a model to recognize handwritten digits. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dataset specifics:\n",
    "- Each image is 28x28 pixels, in grayscale.\n",
    "- The task involves classifying these images into 10 categories (digits 0–9).\n",
    "- This is a **classification problem**.\n",

    "# NN Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we will be building a simple neural network with only **3 layers**: Input, Hidden, and Output. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Layer Breakdown:\n",
    "- **Input Layer**: \n",
    "  - The first layer consists of **784 nodes** because each of the 784 pixels from the 28x28 MNIST images will map to a node. This will serve as our input layer.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Hidden Layer**: \n",
    "  - The second layer will be our **hidden layer** with **10 units** (nodes).\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Output Layer**: \n",
    "  - The third layer will be the **output layer**, also with **10 units**. Since we are classifying digits (0-9), we need 10 output units to predict one of the 10 categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Forward Propagation\n",
    "In the first layer, also known as the **input layer**, we use **forward propagation** to pass the data through the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the variables used in forward propagation:\n",
    "- **A0**: This represents the input layer. It is simply equal to the input data **x**, as no processing occurs at this stage.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Z1**: This represents the un-activated hidden layer. In this layer, we apply weights and biases to **Z1** so that the neural network can learn patterns rather than memorize them. To introduce non-linearity, we apply an **activation function** to **Z1**. This ensures that each node is a **linear combination** of its corresponding nodes.\n",
    "  - The activation function we will use here is **ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)**, which allows the network to learn non-linear relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **A1**: This is the output of the hidden layer after applying the **ReLU** activation function to every value in **Z1**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Z2**: This represents the second set of weights that connect the hidden layer to the output layer. At this stage, we apply the **Softmax** activation function, which gives the output a probability distribution between 0 and 1, allowing us to make predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Backward Propagation\n",
    "Now, moving to **backward propagation**, we calculate the gradients and adjust the weights to minimize errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the variables used in backward propagation:\n",
    "- **dz2**: This represents the error term for the output layer. It is calculated by comparing the predicted output to the actual label. We use this error to adjust the weights in the output layer.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **dw2**: This is the derivative of the loss function with respect to the weights in the output layer. It tells us how much each weight in the output layer contributed to the error.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **db2**: This represents the average error of the output layer, helping to adjust the biases accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **dz1**: This is the error term for the hidden layer. It tells us how much each weight in the hidden layer contributed to the error in the output layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "I know all of this may sound complex at first, but trust me, once you start coding and seeing how the variables fit together, it will make much more sense. Stay strong, and let's get coding!\n",

    "\n",
    "As you can see from the prediction examples above, the model was able to make predictions on 4 examples, out of which 3 were correct, and 1 was incorrect. Given our model's average accuracy of **86%**, this performance is quite decent.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Future Work:**\n",
    "In the future, we can improve the model further by:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Fine-tuning it more, for example, by adjusting the learning rate or applying a dynamic learning rate.\n",
    "* Adding more hidden layers to improve the model’s ability to capture complex relationships.\n",
    "* Training the model for longer periods to improve convergence and overall performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:**\n",
    "The primary objective of this project was to gain a deeper understanding of how a basic neural network works. I believe this knowledge will be valuable in future work, as it provides insights into why and how these techniques are used in machine learning and AI applications.\n"
